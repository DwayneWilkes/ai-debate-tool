# About the AI Debate Tool

This is the official documentation site for AI Debate Tool created by Dwayne Wilkes. The goal of this tool is to provide an interface to have two models of varying capabilities debate each others accuracy, for a given topic. This tool is intended to be a means of interactive debate (see [AI safety via debate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00899) and [Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06782)) to help a non-expert user assess the "correctness" of a given model.
